# magic_storage

Magic storage is a Python package providing wrapper classes for storage (or
rather caching) resources, primarily those used in tests. However classes
available here are quite universal, despite their slight test-conformability
tint.

It aims to make caching test resources clean and easy, to require minimal
amount of boilerplate and possibly simple structure of stored data.

## Installing

Install and update using pip:

```
$ pip install -U magic_storage
```
